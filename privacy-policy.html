<h4 class="notranslate">Цели на обработката</h4>
<ul role="list">
<li class="notranslate">Отговаряне на запитвания и заявки, подадени чрез формата за контакт на уебсайта.</li>
<li class="notranslate">Изпращане на бюлетин до потребители, които са дали изрично съгласие за абонамент. Тези съобщения се изпращат само по заявка на потребителя и&nbsp;<strong>не са автоматизирани маркетингови имейли</strong>&nbsp;.</li>
<li class="notranslate">Анализиране на трафика и потребителското поведение на уебсайта с цел подобряване на предлаганите услуги, използвайки Google Analytics.</li>
<li class="notranslate">Административни цели, свързани с управлението и поддръжката на уебсайта.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="notranslate">Правно основание за обработка</h4>
<ul role="list">
<li class="notranslate"><strong>Съгласие (чл. 6(1)(а) от GDPR):</strong>&nbsp;за изпращане на бюлетини &mdash; след като потребителят предостави изрично, информирано съгласие (свободно дадено, конкретно, информирано и недвусмислено[1).</li>
<li class="notranslate"><strong>Легитимен интерес (чл. 6(1)(f) от GDPR):</strong>&nbsp;за обработка на запитвания и анализ на трафика. Обработването е необходимо, за да се отговори на потребителските заявки и да се подобри уебсайтът, като същевременно се защитават интересите и правата на потребителите.</li>
</ul>
<p class="notranslate">GDPR изисква всички обработки на лични данни да бъдат законосъобразни и прозрачни[2. Ние обработваме данните в стриктно съответствие с принципите за минимизиране и ограничаване на целите (няма да събираме или съхраняваме повече данни от необходимото за посочените цели[3).</p>
<h4 class="notranslate">Период на съхранение на данни</h4>
<p class="notranslate">Личните данни се съхраняват не по-дълго от необходимото за целите на обработката[3. В този случай данните (име и имейл) се съхраняват в продължение на&nbsp;<strong>5 години</strong>&nbsp;от последния контакт с потребителя (напр. последно запитване или потвърждение на абонамент). След този период данните се изтриват или анонимизират, освен ако законът не изисква по-дълго съхранение.</p>
<h4 class="notranslate">Права на субектите на данни</h4>
<p class="notranslate">Съгласно GDPR, всеки субект на данни има следните права:</p>
<ul role="list">
<li class="notranslate"><strong>Право на достъп:</strong>&nbsp;да се знае дали и какви лични данни се обработват и да се получи копие[4.</li>
<li class="notranslate"><strong>Право на коригиране:</strong>&nbsp;да поискате коригиране на неточни или непълни данни[5.</li>
<li class="notranslate"><strong>Право на заличаване (&bdquo;право да бъдеш забравен&ldquo;):</strong>&nbsp;да поискате заличаване на данни, ако те вече не са необходими за посочените цели или съгласието е оттеглено[5.</li>
<li class="notranslate"><strong>Право на ограничаване:</strong>&nbsp;временно спиране на обработката на данните им (напр. докато се проверява точността).</li>
<li class="notranslate"><strong>Право на преносимост на данните:</strong>&nbsp;да получите личните си данни, предоставени в структуриран, широко използван и машинночетим формат, или да ги прехвърлите на друг администратор.</li>
<li class="notranslate"><strong>Право на възражение:</strong>&nbsp;да възразите срещу обработването на данни на основания, свързани с обществен или законен интерес (напр. за директен маркетинг).</li>
<li class="notranslate"><strong>Право на оттегляне на съгласието:</strong>&nbsp;по всяко време, без това да засяга законосъобразността на обработването преди оттеглянето.</li>
<li class="notranslate"><strong>Право на подаване на жалба:</strong>&nbsp;до&nbsp;<strong>Комисията за защита на личните данни (КЗЛД)</strong>&nbsp;в България, ако са нарушени права.</li>
</ul>
<p class="notranslate">Тези права могат да бъдат упражнени чрез свързване с администратора на лични данни (имейл адрес по-горе) или подаване на жалба до КЗЛД.</p>
<h4 class="notranslate">Споделяне на данни с трети страни</h4>
<p class="notranslate">Ние не споделяме лични данни с трети страни, освен ако изрично не е посочено в тази политика.&nbsp;<strong>Не</strong>&nbsp;използваме външни CRM системи, маркетингови платформи или услуги като Mailchimp. Единственият трансфер на данни е с&nbsp;<strong>Google Analytics</strong>&nbsp;, който действа като обработващ данни по наши инструкции[6. В противен случай вашите данни се обработват вътрешно само от администраторите.</p>
<h4 class="notranslate">Използване на Google Analytics</h4>
<p class="notranslate">Нашият уебсайт използва&nbsp;<strong>Google Analytics</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; услуга за уеб анализ от Google LLC &mdash; за събиране на анонимизирана статистика за трафика (чрез &bdquo;бисквитки&ldquo;). Вие се съгласявате с използването на &bdquo;бисквитки&ldquo; за анализ на трафика. Вашият IP адрес е анонимизиран и ние преглеждаме само обобщени отчети, така че да не се идентифицират лица. Съгласно GDPR, ние сме администратор на данни, а Google действа единствено като обработващ от наше име[6.</p>
<h4 class="notranslate">Защита на данните</h4>
<p class="notranslate">&bdquo;ИТ Секюрити БГ&ldquo; ООД внедрява някои или всички от следните технически и организационни мерки за защита на личните данни: SSL криптиране, защита на сървъра, ограничен достъп на персонала, редовни одити на ИТ сигурността и др. Обработката се извършва с &bdquo;подходящо ниво на сигурност&ldquo;, включително предотвратяване на неоторизиран достъп, както се изисква от GDPR[7. Това гарантира поверителността и целостта на вашите данни.</p>
